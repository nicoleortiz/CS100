My name is Nicole.

Bananas are yellow.
Bananas are good.
Bananaa are healthy.

Hope is the Thing With Feathers,
That perches in the soul and sings the tune without the words and never stops at.
And sweetest in the gale is heard 
and sore must be the storm that could abash the little bird
that kept so many warm.
